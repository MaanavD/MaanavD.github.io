    <div class="message-body">
      As the first programming language I learned, Java is the one I am most comfortable with and have the most depth of knowledge
      in. My capabilities range from arrays and algorithms to helper classes (audio, file input, <strong>Java Swing</strong>). I have also delved
      into <strong>object oriented programming</strong>, demonstrated with my rendition of MineSweeper. Through self-education, I also 
      grasped other concepts such as basic algorithms and data structures such as <strong>ArrayLists</strong>, <strong>searching</strong> and <strong>sorting</strong>.

    <div class="message-body">
      Currently, Web Development is among my favourite hobbies. Using my skills in UX/UI design to design meaningful interfaces
      is how I came to this version (the 4th) of my website. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as the CSS 
      frameworks <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Bulma</strong>. To effectively web develop, I use a specific process 
      I created involving idea generation, wireframes, photoshop mockups, and finally creation of a website. I am also currently learning <strong>React</strong>.

      <p>Python</p>

    <div class="message-body">
      Currently, I am learning Python in school in my pursuit to be a Software Engineer. Although I don't yet have much to show for it,
      my desire is to use Python's intuitive nature and efficient classes in solving algorithm problems I get during interviews and challenges.
       Eventually, I also want to try out machine learning, specifically creating neural networks to beat games. I'm also keen on using 
       <strong>Django</strong> as another way to learn about web development, specifically learning the MVT pattern.

    <div class="message-body has-text-black">
      The Adobe Design Suite is a package of software near and dear to my heart. The main softwares I use is <strong>Photoshop</strong>, 
      <strong>Illustrator</strong>, and <strong>InDesign</strong>. I have some experience with Premiere Pro. The reason I enjoy these programs
      enable me to be successful while creating. Either helping me edit photos, put together wireframes for websites, or design my resume, 
      whenever I have a creative desire or pursuit, Adobe's products are the first I turn to. I use these skills to graphic design and create media.
